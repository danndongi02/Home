			<h1>History</h1>
				<p>I'm going to tell you a brief history of the name '<i>The White Highlands</i>'.</p>
				<p><b>The White Highlands</b>, according to wikipedia, is an area in the central uplands of Kenya. It has been the homeland of indigenous 
				Central Kenyan communitiesup to the colonial period, when it became the centre of European settlement in Kenya. Between 1902 and 1961, 
				it was officially reserved for te exclusive use of Europeans by the colonial government.</p>
				<p><b>Exploration:</b> Early explorers and adminstrators were attracted to the cool climate and the abscence of populations over the large 
				swathes of the highlands, and prefered it for European settlement in sub-tropical Africa. In 1893, <i>Frederick Lugard</i> noted that European settlement 
				in the region was not possible until the cooler Highlands were made accessible. This view was echoed by <i>Sir Harry Johnstone</i> who noted the highlands 
				on completion of the Uganda Railway.</p>
				<p><b>Settlement:</b> In 1902, <i>Sir Charles Eliot</i> encouraged settlement of the Highlands for farming. He believed that the only way 
				to recoup the money spent on construction of the railway was by opening up the Highlands for farming. By 1903, there were about 100 European settlers in the 
				Highlands. By 1914, there were about a thousand European settlers in the Highlands.By 1930, approximately 65% of the land reserved for Europeans 
				was not under any form of agriculturally productive activity.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The reservation of the White Highlands for Europeans by administrative practice was ended by the <i>Land Control Regulations</i> in 1961. Kenya later gained independence 
				in the year 1963. Today, the region is at the heart of Kenya's economy. It is the country's best served region by road and rail and has many flourishing cities. It prodeces most o Kenya's 
				agricultural exports.</p>

			<h1>Locality</h1>
				<p>Now, I live in an area called 'Muguga' near Kikuyu. It is a small location with a substantial population. It is on your way to Limuru town, which is 
				one of the towns close to my area. Other close towns include Kikuyu and Nairobi City, which is the capital city of Kenya. It is easily accessible by 
				road. In fact, The Great North Road is the main highway that is used to access it.</p>

			<h1>Economic Activities</h1>
				<p>There are various economic activities carried out in the area. In the area around Muguga, kiosks are in plenty. There is also an open air market availabe 
				where you can go and buy your groceries at an affordable price. The kiosks round sell a variety of things, ranging from the house necessities to animal feeds.
				The closest town to my area is Kikuyu town. Here, you will find supermarkets and also kiosks are present and in plenty.</p>
				<p>Farming is one of the most practised economic activities in my area. It is also one of the main sources of income for most of the residents here. People grow various 
				crops, but the main one is maize and beans. People also keep animals like chicken, cows, pigs and sheep. These are just but a few of the activities people do to earn an income in this area.</p>
